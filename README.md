# sqlite-viewer extension

See and manage your SQLite databases easily.

## Features

The extension allows you to view (browse) SQLite databases to see the data and to perform some basic operations like update, delete and insert data (you do not need any SQL at all).

The user interface was made with HTML/CSS/Javascript. You can install the extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace: <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanGerardoMedellinIbarra.sqlite-viewer-browser>
or from the 'Extensions' option in the side menu in your VSCode (search for 'Sqlite Viewer-Browser'). I made this application as a personal tool to work with sqlite databases.

## Release Notes

This is my first extension for VSCode. I appreciate any feedback or contribution to improve the project.

I made this project as a personal tool because I'm always looking for an application to view my SQLite databases, and I normally do not want to download and install anything on my computer, so I decided to make this application directly for VSCode.

### 1.0.1

Updated README file with a nice .gif and updated some spaces between some components in the ui.

### 1.0.0
